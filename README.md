👋 Hi, I’m @w33ked, a security researcher focused on blockchain and smart contract security. I specialize in testing, auditing, and securing systems against real-world attacks.

👀 I’m interested in smart contract auditing, blockchain protocol security, and vulnerability research.

🛠 I have 2 years of experience with Solidity, Rust, Go, and JavaScript, giving me hands-on insight into common pitfalls and exploits in blockchain ecosystems.

🌱 I’m currently deepening my expertise in Golang and advanced blockchain/dlt security.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bug bounty programs, smart contract audits, and security research projects.
